As we head towards the end
We're overflowing
The surface just about to break
As it's spread and torn
As it's ripped and torn

A cry rings out full of boiling anger
A faceless mouth with gnashing teeth
As the form continues to linger
Shapeless malice soon reveals that

We're walking on a rope that is worn and frayed
We're standing on the edge, pushed to bend or break
Staring down a trap that's designed to take
Everything you have, so don't you let it

We're on the edge
So take that step

Walk into a future so bright shimmering with light
Can't return to the life you abandoned
But you never have to walk this path alone
Step into that future you'll see twist reality
Clip the roots of the sins that were growing
Cut away at the emotions that will show
Reveal the heartless tone
Feel it echo like a gong

I've witnessed hunger deep within
Seen it crumble
A blade unsharpened never wins
Cutting to the core

Conflict ever eternal
In the sand, a line is drawn
Inside, wrestle with demons
In this fight for right and wrong

Castle in the sky hangs in disarray
Appearance to be kept, keep the sins at bay
The path won't reappear, be it night or day
These voices inside, what are they saying?

Take back those skies
Open your eyes

Climb into a future, hazy past what we can see
At the summit of hatred and mercy
Clouds of doubt are cast and shadow what you know
Fly into this future, trust me, hold to destiny
Break the chains that bound you in mourning
Spread your wings and rise above this woe
I can feel it in my soul
This heart I want to show
I can feel it in my soul
I just want to let you know
